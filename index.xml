      <description>This post is about my new R package ConversionPath which aims to put together a number of useful tools for analyzing conversion path data commonly encountered in digital marketing and MTA analysis.
If you want to try it out you can download the development version from my github
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;bdshaff/conversionpath&amp;quot;) Estimate a Transition Matrix from Data library(ConversionPath) set.seed(007) fit_transition_matrix performs the simple task of estimating a transition matrix.</description>

      <description>Binary Image Classification with Keras in R (Apple M1 Chip) The exercise is done on hardware with an Apple M1 Chip and using R interface to Keras. This means that the versions of R, Python, TensorFlow and Keras are all versions that run natively on the M1 Chip. If you prefer to use R and use an M1 mac then here are a few useful links:</description>

      <description>What is Attribution Modeling Attribution modeling is a task that comes up in Digital Marketing. Broadly speaking the objective of Attribution modeling is to improve the assessment of various Advertising Channels in driving Marketing Objectives. Before jumping to the data analysis let’s first set the context for the problem that Markov Chain Attribution modeling addresses.
With this post I am aiming to cover the following:</description>

      <description>Singular Value Decomposition The SVD is one of the most useful matrix decomposition when it comes to Data Science. It’s used in practice for solving regression problems, various dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA, recommendation systems, image processing, and the list goes on.
My favorite thing about the SVD is that once you have the fundamentals of Linear Algebra down the SVD becomes pretty intuitive and easy to remember. I even coded it up myself with Rcpp - though admittedly my function is not as robust as what you will get with the out of the box functions in R or Python.</description>

      <title>QR Method to Compute Eigenvalues</title>

      <description>Eigenvalues In Linear Algebra and consequently in Data Science the concept of Eigenvalues is pretty important and useful to know given how often it comes up. You may encounter them when going over estimation of regression coefficients, unsupervised machine learning and dimensionality reduction, as well as all over mathematics and engineering. Outside of statistics I remember eigenvecotors being important in solving differential equations.</description>

      <description>About the blog: this is my space for publishing data science related thoughts. The posts will be about things that I learn, play with or revise. Sometimes I’ll share my thoughts about industry and career.
About me: I work in analytics in the advertising/media industry so the overarching function is to use data as a resource to generate insights and help clients make decisions. The spectrum of work is large ,ranging from developing software tools in R, working within database environments, doing adhoc and more formal data analysis, and of course tinkering with Microsoft Office tools.</description>
