      <description>Singular Value Decomposition The SVD is one of the most useful matrix decomposition when it comes to Data Science. Itâ€™s used in practice for solving regression problems, various dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA, recommendation systems, image processing, and the list goes on.
My favorite thing about the SVD is that once you have the fundamentals of Linear Algebra down the SVD becomes pretty intuitive and easy to remember. I even coded it up myself with Rcpp - though admittedly my function is not as robust as what you will get with the out of the box functions in R or Python.</description>
